Many of us probably remember the days of browser toolbars, random popups, life before tabs, browser windows playing music that can't be muted, and browsing the WAP on our pre-smartphones without images or color. We’ve come a long way since then; things have become more sophisticated and nuanced. While many of our old issues were resolved, there are still people out there trying to exploit every tiny loophole for an advantage.

### Our Mission: To annoy, amuse, and enlighten – safely!

This project began as a way to showcase the most annoying things on the web in a distilled and exaggerated form, while keeping the end-user safe. It’s not intended to be a fully-fledged website but rather a playful experiment for fun seekers, developers, and maybe even UX professionals. Nothing here is meant to be malicious; we’re just celebrating (and gently roasting) the history of terrible UX in a safe, contained space.

The ultimate goal is to not only have a few but as much of these experiences here as possible, nut just a one trick pony.

### Why Did We Do This?

Why not? Someone had to! It's great to collect these experiences in one single place.

### What You’ll Find Here

This is not a comprehensive list, but here are some highlights of the features currently in place:

- Unsolvable captchas
- A small, useless chat bubble at the bottom that only responds after you’ve closed it
- A “wheel of fortune” that gives no reward — but at least it doesn’t ask for your email
- Newsletter popups that appear when you scroll down and every time you switch tabs
- Impossible-to-unsubscribe questions reminiscent of sites that make it difficult to unsubscribe
- A super lengthy signup form with unexpected constraints and input methods
- A confirmation prompt when you try to close the page
- “DILF” ads — our version of the usual of the well known "bored middle-aged women" ads
- A search page with absurd top searches and random slowdowns
- A dead pixel on the screen, just to keep people on edge
- A “claim your phone” ad inspired by those fake surveys that steal personal info (which is NOT the case here!)
- A content paywall where you can only enable content pixel by pixel
- A recipe that begins with a super long backstory
- AI-generated weird images
- Requests for notification permissions (does anyone even use this feature?)
- An updating page title to draw you back when you switch tabs
- And many more…
