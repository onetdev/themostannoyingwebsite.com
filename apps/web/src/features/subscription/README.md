# Subscription Feature

A special version of a content that seemingly provided packages and features for users. This is a variant of content rather than actual subscription that can be purchased.

## Key highlights

- **Plans page** to provide a well known 3-step package comparison page with fun content details
- **Plans service** allows access to packages and features across the whole application.

## Out of scope

- Any kind of backend integration
- Payment integration
