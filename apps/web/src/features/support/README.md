# Support Feature

Implements intentionally difficult and high-friction "help" and support systems.

## Key highlights

- **Contact form** that opens a new tab using `mailto:*` protocol (skipping backend integration)
- **Chat bubble**
  - When you load the page it always has a new message for you
  - It will only append new messages if it is closed
  - Once sound is enabled it will also display sound

## Out of scope

- Real customer support integration
- Real AI chatbot
