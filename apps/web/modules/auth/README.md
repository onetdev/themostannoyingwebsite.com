# Auth Module

Please note that this module is not intended to be working at all, the goal of everything in here is to allow weird form interactions.

- **FakeAuthRepository**: A fake implementation of the AuthRepository interface for testing purposes.
- **Login and registration forms**: Components and utilities for handling login and registration forms.
