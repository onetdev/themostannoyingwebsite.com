  Aurelia was just another kid at Knight's Institute, but she wasn't into all the “be noble and virtuous” vibes her teachers kept pushing. Like, no one: literally no one: her mom kept saying, “You're gonna meet your one true love here.” But honestly? Big yikes. If chivalry wasn't dead, it was definitely on life support, and none of these noble wannabes had the main character energy she was manifesting.

  While other kids studied court etiquette and swordsmanship, Aurelia was way more into her enchanted mirror. Her mirror was like a portal to all the juiciest reels and enchanted scrolls, showing her the dramas and epic fails of every noble across the kingdom. Every night after classes, she'd sneak off, mirror in hand, and highkey check out the reels of the other nobles' lives, laughing at their cringey moments. Sometimes, she'd even scroll into the comments, where sassy villagers and nobles alike would drop phrases like “Arch your back while you're at it!” or call each other out with “catch these hands!” It was the literal G.O.A.T. of entertainment.

  One night, she watched a reel of this short king knight-in-training named Sir Percival, who was doing his best to show off his sword skills. The dude was swinging his sword like it weighed twice as much as he did, and his squire was hyping him up, dropping “Gyatt!” and “Bruh moment!” in the comments. It was giving major NPC behavior, but honestly? Aurelia was here for it. She laughed so hard she nearly dropped her mirror, muttering, “Big F in chat for Sir Percival.”

  The whole “find true love” thing was way overrated. Like, her mom was constantly on her, saying, “Aurelia, you need to catch the attention of a nobleman! This isn't a game!” But she wasn't about to settle for some boomer energy dude with zero Rizz. She wanted someone with main character vibes, maybe even a little chaotic good. Highkey, she'd been manifesting hard rn, picturing herself with a guy who was adventurous, mysterious, and could fight a dragon without breaking a sweat.

  Enter Lysander. He was a rogue knight and absolutely dripped in sigma energy, and when Aurelia first spotted him at the royal banquet, she thought, “It's giving… legend vibes.” The guy had drip for days, and he moved with this quiet confidence that screamed Chad energy. Every time he looked at her, she felt like he'd cast some enchanted spell. Her friends were all, “Bet. This is your guy. Total knight in shining armor.”

  But the more she got to know him, the more ick she started picking up on. At first, it was little things, like how he'd suddenly disappear for days without a word. Then she'd hear rumors about him caught in 4k with other noble girls, and every time she'd bring it up, he'd just gaslight her, all like, “Say sike right now! You're imagining things, Aurelia.” And she'd sit there, telling herself, “If I ignore it, it doesn't exist.” But the delusion started to feel more like a trap than a fairytale, and Aurelia began to think, “delulu is the solulu,” but not in a good way.

  Meanwhile, her mom had this other plan cooking up. Enter Lord Eldric, the “safe” choice. Her parents had been pushing him on her forever. He wasn't the mysterious knight or the rogue with Chad energy, but he was sturdy, kind of cute in a himbo energy way, and actually respected her space. Lowkey, Eldric was sort of based. He wasn't trying to impress her with fancy swordplay or bussin' clothes; he was just… Eldric. Simple, stable, not a walking ick machine.

  One day, she was chatting with her friend, who was totally done with Aurelia's pining for Lysander, saying, “Girl, this ain't it, chief. You're thriving in your little delulu world, but highkey, Lord Eldric's just vibing here waiting for you to notice him.” And Aurelia thought about it, realizing her friend might be right. Bruh. She'd been caught up in all the drama, chasing some fantasy rogue knight when the real deal was right in front of her, sipping tea and chilling with total unbothered, moisturized, in his lane vibes.

  She decided to test it. She hung out with Eldric a few times, thinking, “I'll just fake it till I make it.” But the more time she spent with him, the more he grew on her. He didn't have Chad energy, but he had this quiet strength and loyalty that felt… real. He treated her like a queen (which, highkey, she was) without all the bitch-moaning and drama. With him, she didn't have to worry about getting caught in 4k with someone else or spilling tea about who he was with last week.

  So finally, she went all-in, saying goodbye to Lysander and his chaotic, toxic sidequest energy. And she agreed to marry Eldric, finally choosing the path her parents had wanted for her. They might not have the epic, Pogchamping romance she'd dreamed of, but he was real. With Eldric, she was safe, respected, and highkey content.

  Aurelia still checks her enchanted mirror every now and then, watching the bruh moments, L romances, and caught in 4k drama of Thaloria, all while sipping her tea and lowkey vibing with her new husband. She might have given up on finding the rogue knight of her dreams, but in the end, she found something even better: peace, stability, and someone who'd deadass catch her every time she fell.
