  Life's little annoyances are enough to drive anyone mad. Stepping into a wet spot with socks on? Instant rage. And that strand of hair constantly brushing your face but never letting you grab it? Infuriating! Then there's the pen that rolls just out of reach, mocking you from under the couch, and don't even get me started on shoelaces that refuse to stay tied no matter how tightly you knot them. Peeling a sticker and being left with that sticky residue? Pure agony. And the moment your sleeve dips into water as you wash your handsâ€”seriously, how does that even happen? These ridiculous, pointless moments make you want to scream, turning a normal day into a series of maddening, rage-inducing battles.
