  In a world where instant gratification has become the norm, there's a growing sense of entitlement that's spiraling out of control. Whether in customer service, social interactions, or even familial dynamics, more people seem to believe that the world owes them something simply for existing. While self-confidence and advocacy are healthy traits, entitlement — where people expect excessive privileges or rewards without merit — has veered into absurdity. From the laughable to the downright cringeworthy, stories from online communities, especially the infamous “Entitled People” subreddit, illustrate just how detached some individuals have become from reality.

  # 1. The Case of the $100 “Thank You”

  One of the more jaw-dropping stories involves a bride and her audacious request for a wedding guest to fork over $100 to make up for a gift deemed “insufficient.” The guest had given a thoughtful gift off the registry, but weeks after the wedding, they received a message from the bride. “I noticed your gift was only worth $25,” the bride said, “which doesn't really cover the cost of your attendance at the wedding. Could you kindly send us an additional $100?”

  This story epitomizes modern entitlement — the expectation that guests should not only honor an invitation but also cover the costs of the host's extravagant choices. The absurdity of this situation lies in the complete lack of gratitude and an over-inflated sense of what others “owe” in return for an invitation to a celebration.

  # 2. Demanding a Discount on a Free Meal

  Another tale comes from a fast food worker who recounted a shocking encounter with a customer on their subreddit. During a promotion, the chain offered a free meal to customers. However, one customer wasn't satisfied with simply receiving a meal at no cost. “Why isn't there a discount on the free soda?” the customer demanded, claiming that even though the soda was part of the free meal, it should come with an additional percentage off the non-existent cost.

  The server, baffled, explained that the meal — including the soda — was already free. Still, the customer argued for several minutes, insisting that a discount on the free item was deserved because, in their words, “everything should come with a deal.”

  # 3. The Parent Who Demanded a Babysitter, Forever

  A post from a young woman recounting an interaction with a distant cousin sheds light on entitlement within family dynamics. After babysitting her cousin's children once, she was bombarded with requests from the cousin, who assumed she'd be a permanent free childcare provider. When the young woman explained that she had a busy schedule and couldn't always be available, her cousin erupted, saying, “I'm family! Don't you care about helping your family? I deserve your time because you're my cousin!”

  Entitlement within family situations can often be trickier to navigate, as some individuals assume that familial ties mean that boundaries don't exist. What should have been a one-time favor quickly escalated into unreasonable expectations of servitude — all because of the belief that family should never say “no.”

  # 4. “Influencers” Expecting Free Everything

  A modern take on entitlement has flourished with the rise of social media influencers, some of whom believe that their “fame” should translate to free services. One story, widely shared online, involves a restaurant owner who received a direct message from a self-proclaimed influencer with a modest following. The influencer promised to post about the restaurant in exchange for a free meal for themselves and three friends.

  When the owner politely declined, explaining that many paying customers enjoy the restaurant's offerings without seeking freebies, the influencer lashed out, accusing the restaurant of not understanding the “power of exposure.” The cherry on top? The influencer had fewer than 2,000 followers. The audacity to demand a free meal for a promise of “exposure” — which in reality offers no guarantee of value to the restaurant — highlights how inflated people's self-worth can become in the social media age.

  # 5. The Tenant Who Demanded a House for Free

  One post detailed the outrageous demands of a tenant who believed they shouldn't have to pay rent because they had “been there so long” that the landlord should be grateful for their presence. After living in the apartment for just over a year, the tenant stopped paying rent and, when confronted, argued that they had “done enough” by being a stable tenant for 12 months.

  They insisted that the landlord was being greedy by expecting continued payment and argued that they deserved free accommodation for their loyalty. Naturally, the landlord wasn't swayed, but the idea that merely staying in a rental property meant they were entitled to free housing underscores just how far entitlement can stretch.

  # Where Does It End?

  Entitlement, it seems, is rooted in a lack of perspective and an over-inflated sense of one's own importance. What's most disturbing about these stories is that, for the people involved, their demands seemed entirely reasonable. They weren't asking — they were expecting.

  So what fuels this mindset? Part of it stems from living in a culture that increasingly prioritizes individualism over community. There's also the rise of social media, where people are constantly being told to “demand what you deserve,” leading some to confuse genuine needs with unreasonable wants. Lastly, the culture of consumerism, which prizes instant gratification, leaves some individuals without the patience to wait or work for what they want, assuming they should receive it just by asking — or, more accurately, demanding.

  # The Bottom Line

  While standing up for oneself is healthy, there's a difference between knowing your worth and being unreasonably entitled. Navigating life means accepting that others don't owe us anything, that gifts and favors are acts of kindness, not obligations. As these stories illustrate, the line between confident self-advocacy and outright entitlement is easily crossed — and it's a dangerous line to blur.

  In the end, the golden rule remains: Treat others with respect. The world doesn't owe us anything, and acting like it does only leads to disappointment, both for the entitled and for those they demand from.
