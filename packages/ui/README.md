# UI library

Contains all the higher level components without caring about Next.js - _it does care about Tailwind_. This package also contains storybook entries but it isn't responsible for actually providing Storybook GUI.

## Installation

### 1. Install the package

```bash
pnpm i @maw/ui
```

### 2. Installing tailwind

Depending on the usage you might also want to configure Tailwind.
